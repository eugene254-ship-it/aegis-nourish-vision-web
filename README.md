🌍 AEGIS-NOURISH
Where Ethics, AI, and Indigenous Knowledge Unite to End Hunger, Disease, and Thirst
A Michael Green–inspired innovation to accelerate real progress on SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being), and SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation).
🔎 Problem
Billions still face:
Malnutrition (SDG 2)
Preventable disease (SDG 3)
Unsafe water (SDG 6)
Progress is uneven, often slowed by:
Broken data systems
Top-down development models
Limited community feedback
Michael Green emphasizes: “GDP doesn’t tell us whether people are dying of preventable diseases or if children are going to school.” Instead, we must measure what matters and empower local solutions.
💡 The Pivot Innovation
AEGIS-NOURISH is a multi-agent AI governance system trained to co-design, deploy, and monitor localized, ethical interventions in food, health, and water — framed around community priorities and measurable social progress.
🧬 Core Components
SDG	AEGIS-NOURISH Feature	Description
SDG 2: Zero Hunger 🌾	AgriEthic Agents	AI agents trained on indigenous food systems + predictive farming + blockchain food supply integrity
SDG 3: Good Health 🏥	CareGraph Agents	Offline-first health dashboards for CHWs, clinics & hospitals. Fuses Sonar Deep Research + local cultural practices
SDG 6: Clean Water 💧	AquaSentinel Network	IoT + satellite + mobile reporting tools for water safety, automated alerts, and ethics-based prioritization (e.g., children & maternal health zones)
📊 Michael Green Integration
Every dashboard integrates Social Progress Index–style metrics, including:
📈 Real-time nutrition & disease rates
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community participation in health planning
💧 Water point functionality reports
🌍 Ethics compliance heatmaps
🛠️ Technologies
Perplexity Sonar → reasoning on SDG tradeoffs & research summaries
LangChain Agents → multi-agent negotiation for ethical resource allocation
Supabase + Vite + TypeScript → rapid prototyping of dashboards
Low-power edge AI → supports rural/off-grid environments
Blockchain transparency → tracking food aid & medicine supply chains
🌱 Why AEGIS-NOURISH?
✔ Community-driven: villagers, youth & elders contribute directly
✔ Data + Wisdom: AI merged with indigenous practices (e.g., medicinal herbs, water divining)
✔ Ethics-first governance: anti-corruption, anti-exclusion, safeguards against AI misuse
✔ Real-time dashboards: action-oriented and aligned with social progress
🏆 Expected Impact by 2030
🌾 45M food-insecure households stabilized across 20 African nations
🧑‍⚕️ 120,000 community health workers (CHWs) gain real-time AI support
💧 9M safe water access points mapped, monitored, and locally governed
📖 Roadmap
 Pilot testing with 3 communities (food, health, water focus)
 Integration of indigenous datasets + ethical AI evaluation
 Expand CareGraph Agents offline-first capabilities
 Scale AquaSentinel across 5+ water-scarce nations
 Public dashboard release with open SPI metrics
