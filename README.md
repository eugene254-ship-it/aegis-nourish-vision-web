# 🌍 AEGIS-NOURISH  
**Where Ethics, AI, and Indigenous Knowledge Unite to End Hunger, Disease, and Thirst**  

> A Michael Green–inspired innovation advancing **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being), and SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation)** through AI governance, community-driven solutions, and social progress measurement.

---

## 🔎 Problem
Billions still face **malnutrition**, **preventable disease**, and **poor access to clean water**.  
Progress is often slowed by:
- Broken data systems  
- Top-down development models  
- Limited feedback from local communities  

> “GDP doesn’t tell us whether people are dying of preventable diseases or if children are going to school.” — *Michael Green*  

---

## 💡 Pivot Innovation
**AEGIS-NOURISH** is a **multi-agent AI governance system** designed to:  
✅ Co-design localized solutions  
✅ Deploy ethical interventions  
✅ Monitor real-time progress  
✅ Empower communities with **data + wisdom**  

All while integrating **Social Progress Index (SPI)-style metrics** into dashboards.

## 🧬 System Components  

| SDG Goal | Component | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** | 🌾 **AgriEthic Agents** | AI trained on indigenous food systems + predictive farming + blockchain-based food supply integrity. |
| **SDG 3: Good Health** | 🏥 **CareGraph Agents** | Offline-first health intelligence dashboards for CHWs, clinics, and hospitals — combining Sonar Deep Research + cultural beliefs. |
| **SDG 6: Clean Water** | 💧 **AquaSentinel Network** | IoT + satellite + mobile reporting for water quality, automated alerts, and ethics-based prioritization (maternal/child zones). |
